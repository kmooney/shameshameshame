          <h4>What's this?</h4>
          <p><a href="/login">Sign up</a> to automatically shout a question at <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> whenever he dashes off a vulgar missive with his tiny fingers on his android phone. <i>(Update: Now you can respond to all of his account's tweets, if you want)</i></p>

          <h4>How's it work?</h4>
          <p>Click the <a href="/login">sign up</a> button above, or just <a href="/login">click here</a>. Sign in with your twitter acccount, then you'll automatically ask a relevant, newsworthy question of the president-elect whenever he tries to distract us with his ridiculous antics. </p><p> Trumppressconference.club will automatically send <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> a newsworthy question on your behalf, seconds after Donald Trump hits "send" on his Android device.  </p><p>The questions are chosen randomly from a pool of a questions that are periodically updated.  Later on, you'll be able to make your own pool of questions. </p>

          <h4>Wait, you tweet in my name?</h4>
          <p>Indeed, that is the idea.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Some guy once said</a> eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, but keeping up with&mdash;and responding to&mdash;all the crazy stuff <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> tweets is tough, especially when he's up tweeting at 3:00am and <b>you've</b> still gotta work in the morning.</p>

<h4>Are you gonna tweet swears on my account?</h4>
          <p>No.  Even though the creators of Trumppressconference.club don't think that <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> deserves any respect or forebearance, Twitter dot com is a public website and <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> isn't the only person who will see them, so we promise not to post swears or threats under your name.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Why does this exist?</h4>
          <p>The president-elect <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> is not engaging with the media.  The only press conference that he has held was non-informative and ended with his aides taunting members of the press.  Also, <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> had his staff members try to intimidate reporters by inspecting their notes as they were taking them!</p><p> Instead of honestly interacting with reporters or anyone else, he tries to control the news cycle by broadcasting on Twitter.  In this way, he can avoid tough and relevant questions that deserve to be answered.</p>

          <h4>How does trumppressconference.club help?</h4>
<p>Trumppressconference.club is designed to make its members into an impromptu press pool.  On its members' behalf, Trumppressconference.club will shout relevant, confrontational and newsworthy questions at <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> whenever he tweets.  Even if he's tweeting at 3:30 in the morning.</p>

          <h4>So what will you tweet?</h4>
          <p>Since you asked nicely, here is the current question pool: <ul class="questions"></ul> </p>
          <p>These questions were all chosen because they are newsworthy questions that we think <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> is trying to avoid answering.  As these questions become irrelevant (perhaps we'll get answers!) and new questions become relevant, we will update them as needed.</p>
          <p>Soon, you'll be able to pick what questions you want to ask.</p>
