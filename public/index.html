          <p>Indeed, that is the idea.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Some guy once said</a> eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, but keeping up with&mdash;and responding to&mdash;all the crazy stuff <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> tweets is tough, especially when he's up tweeting at 3:00am and <b>you've</b> still gotta work in the morning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Why does this exist?</h4>
          <p>The president-elect <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> is not engaging with the media.  As of January 4th 2017, he hasn't held an official press conference yet and hasn't indicated any plan to do so.  Instead, he tries to control the news cycle by posting tweets and making announcements on Twitter.  In this way, he can avoid tough and relevant questions that deserve to be answered.</p>

          <h4>How does trumppressconference.club help?</h4>
<p>Trumppressconference.club is designed to make its members into an impromptu press pool.  On its members' behalf, Trumppressconference.club will shout relevant, confrontational and newsworthy questions at <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> whenever he tweets.  Even if he's tweeting at 3:30 in the morning.</p>

          <h4>Are you gonna tweet swears on my account?</h4>
          <p>No.  Even though the creators of Trumppressconference.club don't think that <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> deserves any respect or forebearance, Twitter dot com is a public website and <span class="tweety">@realDonaldTrump</span> isn't the only person who will see them, so we promise not to post swears or threats under your name.</p>
